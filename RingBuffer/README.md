# RingBuffer

This template class provides a ring buffer implementation.

## Installation

Just copy the files from this directory to your project.

## Usage

### Creating a RingBuffer

The following example creates a ring buffer for up to 20 ```String``` objects. If more than 20 objects are added to the ring buffer, then the oldest object is removed from the ring buffer.


```cpp
# include "Ringbuffer.h"

RingBuffer<String>	ringBuffer(20);
```

**Note**: This template class doesn't do memory management on the stored objects. The creation and deletion of elements must be done by the using application.

### Adding Elements

The following example adds a String object to a ring buffer.

```cpp
String str = "Hello, World";

ringBuffer.add(str);
```

As a shortcut, the *=* operator can be used:

```cpp
String str = "Hello, World";

ringBuffer = str;
```

### Getting Elements

This code example retrieves and print elements from the ring buffer:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < ringBuffer.count(); i++) {
	Serial.println(ringBuffer.get(i));
}
```

The ``count()`` method returns the current number of elements in the ring buffer. Please note, that this is not necessarily the size of the ring buffer.

Alternatively, the *[]* operator can be used instead of the ``get()`` method:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < ringBuffer.count(); i++) {
	Serial.println(ringBuffer[i]);
}
```

When one needs to retrieve the elements in the ring buffer in reverse order the ``getReverse()`` method can be used instead.

The ``getOldest()`` and ``getLatest()`` methods can be used to retrieve the oldest resp. the newest element in the ring buffer.

```cpp
String oldest = ringBuffer.getOldest();
String newest = ringBuffer.getLatest();
```

### Slicing the RingBuffer

Sometimes it is useful to remove elements from the relative beginning, relative end, or both ends of the ring buffer:

```cpp
ringBuffer.sliceTail(2);  // remove 2 elements from the relative end
ringBuffer.sliceHead(2);  // remove 2 elements from the relative start
ringBuffer.slice(2);      // remove 2 elements from both ends, 4 elements overall
```

### Miscellaneous Methods

The ``clear()`` method is used to remove all elements from the ring buffer.

```cpp
ringBuffer.clear()
```

The ``size()`` method returns the maximum size of the ring buffer.

To check whether the ring buffer is empty or not full, the ``isEmpty()`` resp. ``isFull()`` methods can be used.

```cpp
if ( ! ringBuffer.isEmpty())
    ringBuffer.clear();

if ( ! ringBuffer.isFull())
    ringBuffer.add(anElement);
```

## Class Documentation

### Constructor
- **RingBuffer(int size)**  
The class's constructor.  
*size* specifies the maximum size of the ring buffer, ie. the number of
elements the ring buffer can hold before starting to overwrite the oldest 
element.

### Class Methods
- **void add(T item)**  
Add an *item* to the end of the ring buffer. If the buffer is full, then the oldest item in the buffer is overwritten.
- **T get(int index)**  
Get an item from the ring buffer. *index* is relative to the beginning of the buffer, ie ```get(0)``` returns the oldest item while ```get(count())``` returns the newest item from the buffer.  
If *index* is invalid, a new object of Type T is returned.
- **T getReverse(int index)**  
Get an item from the ring buffer. This method acts exactly in reverse to the *get()* method, ie ```get(0)``` returns the newest item while ```get(count())``` returns the oldest item from the buffer.  
If *index* is invalid, a new object of Type T is returned.
- **T getOldest()**  
Get the oldest item from the ring buffer.  
If the buffer is empty, a new object of Type T is returned.
- **T getLatest()**  
Get the latest item from the ring buffer.  
If the buffer is empty, a new object of Type T is returned.
- **bool slice(int count)**  
Remove *count* elements from the tail and head of the ring buffer. The size of the ring buffer is reduced by *count* * 2 items.  
The method returns true if successful, false otherwise.
- **bool sliceHead(int count)**  
Remove *count* elements from the head of the ring buffer. The size of the ring buffer is reduced by *count* items.  
The method returns true if successful, false otherwise.
- **bool sliceTail(int count)**  
Remove *count* elements from the tail of the ring buffer. The size of the ring buffer is reduced by *count* items.  
The method returns true if successful, false otherwise.
- **void clear()**  
Empty the ring buffer. Objects in the ring buffer are **not** deleted from memory.
- **int size()**  
Return the size of the ring buffer.
- **int count()**  
Return the number of elements in the ring buffer.
- **bool isEmpty()**  
Check whether the ring buffer is empty.
- **bool isFull()**  
Check whether the ring buffer is full.
- **T operator[](int index)**  
Using this assignment operator is equivalent to calling the *get()* method.
- **RingBuffer&lt;T> &operator=(T item)**  
Using this assignment operator is equivalent to calling the *add()* method.
